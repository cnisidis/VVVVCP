**3d_project_settings**
**This file is meant to set the required nodes so to achieve**
**the best coordination between all of the contributors**

As probably we will have to face the chance that multiple 3d Model Editors (3dme) will be used in this project I'd suggest following

PROJECT SETTINGS:

Project Units: Centimeter
Axis Scale: 1
Axis: Left Handed
	Positive X: to your right
	Negative X: to your left
Up Axis: Y
Depth Axis: Z (depth positive values away from screen; negative towards screen)

**please add here
**probably also an approximate bounding box for monster should be pointed out...
